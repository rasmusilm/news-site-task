# Test task NewsApi

Ths frontend is written to mainly use the public NewsAPI endpoints. 
Ultimately wrote it using Vue.js, as this allowed me to get going faster and focus more on the design/setup aspect.

To login, you will need to fill out the API key field and then use the login button.
Then the app will use said key to access the everything endpoint of the api and present you with articles from there.
the article/story view could be considered a little incomplete, as to get the actual content of the articles, I would
have to write an additional webscraper, and that would take quite some time, considering the different news sources and etc.
